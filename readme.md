# TT Video field (Drupal 8)


## Info

If you want to return full vimeo urls for the videos, set "vimeo_api_get_full_urls" to true in settings.local.php and add a "vimeo_api_access_token". You can add the access token in the Vimeo app development UI.

## Todo
- Save setting wether to include full video urls or not in the database.
- Save video urls in db instead of state.
